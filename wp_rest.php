			<p>It's a holiday! Enjoy, take a day off from the gym.</p>
			<p>Remember, it's just as important to rest your muscles as much as it is to exert them. Make sure to keep a gap of at least <b>24 hours</b> before repeating workout for any muscle group. Over exertion can lead to serious injury, then it's bye-bye gym for a long time, or even worse, forever. Be careful!</p>
